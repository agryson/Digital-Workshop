*** ALEXANDER GRYSON'S DIGITAL WORKSHOP ***
The digital workshop is my little space for tinkering with code and learning through hobbyist projects. 

I use only online or mobile tools for all of my work:
CODE: Cloud9 IDE, JSFiddle
ART/DESIGN: Pixlr editor, Sketchbook Pro, Mockup.me
NOTES & PLANNING: Google Docs

All of the projects are kept together for easy bulk download with the following hierarchy:
ROOT 
I_> MAIN PAGE
   I_> PROJECT 1
   I_> PROJECT 2
   I_>  ...
   I_> PROJECT n

I try to keep them well documented and referenced but I am human so if you see anything missing or poorly explained, ping me and I'll update.
Each project contains its own readme which explains the project and references.

Because I'm only a hobbyist, I'm more likely to reinvent the wheel than come up with anything genuinely novel, but for those who, like me, learn better by looking at lots of code, everything here is free to download, use, reuse, hack, bend and distort for on only one condition :
