This code was heavily inspired by this tutorial on DevX : 
    http://www.devx.com/webdev/10MinuteSolution/27134/0/page/1

I simply edited it to work with two paddles, and have appropriate scoring and reset
conditions.

An advantage of my implementation is that I don't use images so theoretically it is 
lower bandwidth.

This first version uses divs but now that I have the game logic right, I'll be 
creating a version taht uses the HTML canvas next.

I've mainly documented the javascript, but there are comments in the HTML to show 
where everything goes.
